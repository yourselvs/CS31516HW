Hello, this year we can hopefully learn some cool stuff and 
have one big project, so in this file I want to list some of
the ideas we are going through.

What we create has to be mostly text-based, as in: no 
animation. It also cannot be coded in Java. Other than that 
there aren't any restrictions, so list any idea you have.

Please do not remove any ideas.




1. Text-based RPG. Procedurally generated map. Images to go along with scenarios.
2. ASCII-based arcade game, such as Space Invaders, Pac-Man, etc.
3. File encryption. Randomly encrypt and decrypt a file based on a password.
